Hi, I'm Chenlin Wang, a just-graduate-non-employed 22-year-old. I got my BS from Department of Mathematics, [Zhejiang University](http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). However, my real passion is coding, learning and working out. I love to enhance the efficiency of my life. I hate to rename files with similar patterns. I fall asleep when I have to download pictures click by click. I believe stupid things should be taken care of by computers. I am not a fanatic of any programming languages. I write Python to help, C++ to work, Scheme to learn and Tex to print. Besides coding, I am very interested in Computer Science topics like: Machine Learning, Computer Vision and Programming Languages. I intend to get a PhD in such areas as to bring more theories into practical uses.

这是王琛林的个人主页。2014年6月30日，我正式从[老和山职业技术学院](http://www.zju.edu.cn)毕业，成为大龄待业青年大军中的一员。在数学系熬到大三，才发现自己喜欢的不是数学，而是数学史;P 平常喜欢用代码解决琐碎的事情。对计算理论，计算机语言学和深度学习比较感兴趣，希望能在这几个领域继续学习，读个Phd。当下正处于啃老一年（也许不止一年）的状态，个人兴趣比较广，属于入可宅起上AC，出可骑行绕西湖的人，喜欢骑行，健身和滑冰。
